Had an issue with styling login and register.html. They wouldn't be centered. 
Solution: created a body class and styled them differently.

Log In page won't display the flash message when a user does not exist in the database. 
Solution: the {{ form.hidden_tag() }} was outside the <form> block and needed to be inside to submit the form properly. Otherwise, it will reject the submission.
